This repository contains supplementary files for the article "Development of a high-throughput field phenotyping rover optimized for size-limited breeding fields as open hardware" (in prep)

## Article
(to be added)

## Contents

### CAD
`cad/assembly.SLDASM` is a 3D CAD file of our field rover's geometry in [SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/) assembly file format. It can be opened by free viewer software [eDrawings Viewer](https://www.edrawingsviewer.com/) 2021 as well as SolidWorks 2021. Files in `cad/parts/` are the components imported to the assembly file. The article also describes components used to assemble the robot.

### Configuration
`config/apRover_KU.kiss` is a [OpenKAI](https://github.com/yankailab/OpenKAI) config file we used for the field trial.

### Images
Files in `images/` are the images captured by the on-board cameras. They are from three cameras and can be used for 3D reconstruction with SfM software such as [COLMAP](https://colmap.github.io/) (open) and [Metashape](https://www.agisoft.com/) (commercial).
